    "## 4. Making predictions with a trained PyTorch model (inference)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've trained a model, you'll likely want to make predictions with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen a glimpse of this in the training and testing code above, the steps to do it outside of the training/testing loop are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three things to remember when making predictions (also called performing inference) with a PyTorch model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set the model in evaluation mode (`model.eval()`).\n",
    "2. Make the predictions using the inference mode context manager (`with torch.inference_mode(): ...`).\n",
    "3. All predictions should be made with objects on the same device (e.g. data and model on GPU only or data and model on CPU only).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two items make sure all helpful calculations and settings PyTorch uses behind the scenes during training but aren't necessary for inference are turned off (this results in faster computation). And the third ensures that you won't run into cross-device errors."

    "\n",
    "If you've trained a PyTorch model, chances are you'll want to save it and export it somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in, you might train it on Google Colab or your local machine with a GPU but you'd like to now export it to some sort of application where others can use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or maybe you'd like to save your progress on a model and come back and load it back later.\n",
    "\n",
    "For saving and loading models in PyTorch, there are three main methods you should be aware of (all of below have been taken from the [PyTorch saving and loading models guide](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html#saving-loading-model-for-inference)):\n",
    "\n",
    "| PyTorch method | What does it do? | \n",
    "| ----- | ----- |\n",
    "| [`torch.save`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html?highlight=save#torch.save) | Saves a serialized object to disk using Python's [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) utility. Models, tensors and various other Python objects like dictionaries can be saved using `torch.save`.  | \n",
    "| [`torch.load`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html?highlight=torch%20load#torch.load) | Uses `pickle`'s unpickling features to deserialize and load pickled Python object files (like models, tensors or dictionaries) into memory. You can also set which device to load the object to (CPU, GPU etc). |\n",
    "| [`torch.nn.Module.load_state_dict`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html?highlight=load_state_dict#torch.nn.Module.load_state_dict)| Loads a model's parameter dictionary (`model.state_dict()`) using a saved `state_dict()` object. | \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** As stated in [Python's `pickle` documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html), the `pickle` module **is not secure**. That means you should only ever unpickle (load) data you trust. That goes for loading PyTorch models as well. Only ever use saved PyTorch models from sources you trust.\n"

    "\n",
    "The [recommended way](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html#saving-loading-model-for-inference) for saving and loading a model for inference (making predictions) is by saving and loading a model's `state_dict()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we can do that in a few steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We'll create a directory for saving models to called `models` using Python's `pathlib` module.\n",
    "2. We'll create a file path to save the model to.\n",
    "3. We'll call `torch.save(obj, f)` where `obj` is the target model's `state_dict()` and `f` is the filename of where to save the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** It's common convention for PyTorch saved models or objects to end with `.pt` or `.pth`, like `saved_model_01.pth`.\n"

    "Why call `torch.load()` inside `torch.nn.Module.load_state_dict()`? \n",
    "\n",
    "Because we only saved the model's `state_dict()` which is a dictionary of learned parameters and not the *entire* model, we first have to load the `state_dict()` with `torch.load()` and then pass that `state_dict()` to a new instance of our model (which is a subclass of `nn.Module`).\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

    "You should be able to complete them by referencing their specific section.\n",

    "1. Create a straight line dataset using the linear regression formula (`weight * X + bias`).\n",
    "  * Set `weight=0.3` and `bias=0.9` there should be at least 100 datapoints total. \n",
    "  * Split the data into 80% training, 20% testing.\n",
    "  * Plot the training and testing data so it becomes visual.\n",
    "2. Build a PyTorch model by subclassing `nn.Module`. \n",
    "  * Inside should be a randomly initialized `nn.Parameter()` with `requires_grad=True`, one for `weights` and one for `bias`. \n",
    "  * Implement the `forward()` method to compute the linear regression function you used to create the dataset in 1. \n",
    "  * Once you've constructed the model, make an instance of it and check its `state_dict()`.\n",
    "  * **Note:** If you'd like to use `nn.Linear()` instead of `nn.Parameter()` you can.\n",
    "3. Create a loss function and optimizer using `nn.L1Loss()` and `torch.optim.SGD(params, lr)` respectively. \n",
    "  * Set the learning rate of the optimizer to be 0.01 and the parameters to optimize should be the model parameters from the model you created in 2.\n",
    "  * Write a training loop to perform the appropriate training steps for 300 epochs.\n",
    "  * The training loop should test the model on the test dataset every 20 epochs.\n",
    "4. Make predictions with the trained model on the test data.\n",
    "  * Visualize these predictions against the original training and testing data (**note:** you may need to make sure the predictions are *not* on the GPU if you want to use non-CUDA-enabled libraries such as matplotlib to plot).\n",
    "5. Save your trained model's `state_dict()` to file.\n",
    "  * Create a new instance of your model class you made in 2. and load in the `state_dict()` you just saved to it.\n",
    "  * Perform predictions on your test data with the loaded model and confirm they match the original model predictions from 4.\n",
